# Audio Sponge (working title)

soak up some sound, and squeeze some sound out

maybe it music! (not yet, not really, unless you're into anti-music/postmusic type stuff)

------------

### Where is it?

this URL will change: https://audio-sponge.glitch.me/

------------

### What it do tho?

* globs a bunch of audio files or streams from SoundCloud (TODO: more sources)

* chooses random slices from the sources (TODO: detect beats and such)

* plays the sounds in random rhythms (TODO: rhyme and reason - and effects!)

* streams to listeners on a [webpage](https://audio-sponge.glitch.me/) (TODO: make this more robust)

### Are these songs?

no they just names:

* In equal and opposite measure
* Cathartic cacophony
* Retched reverbertations
* Spontanious sound shenanigans
* Automatic chaotic euphony
* Synthetic symphonic hodgepodge
* Percussive pandemonium & rambunctious rhythm
* Wayward librettist - ~~Markov~~\* would be so ...-und (sound)
* Select the server other is file not play
* Large birds, soft cheese, green fruit
* A gathering of empty places
* I would understand a colorless green idea
* Cozy paranoia
* Primary reality beta
<!-- * Warning: abstraction required -->

\*It would be ["nonsensical"](https://github.com/1j01/nonsensical) for me to use plain old Markov text chains in this project (considering I've made a sentence generator of my own (and could adapt that more easily))
