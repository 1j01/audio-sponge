soak up some sound, and squeeze some out

maybe it music

### what it do tho:

* globs a bunch of audio files (TODO: stream from other sources)

* chooses random ranges in the sources (TODO: detect beats and such)

* plays sounds back with random rhythms (TODO: rhyme and reason)

* streams to listeners on a webpage (TODO: host stream and site)

------------

### Are these songs?

no they just names:

* In equal and opposite measure
* Cathartic cacophony
* Retched reverbertations
* Spontanious sound shenanigans
* Automatic chaotic euphony
* Synthetic symphonic hodgepodge
* Percussive pandemonium & rambunctious rhythm
* Wayward librettist - ~~Markov~~ would be so und
* Select the server other is file not play
* Large birds, soft cheese, green fruit
* A gathering of empty places
* I would understand a colorless green idea
* Cozy paranoia
* Primary reality beta
<!-- * Every day route and patch -->
<!-- * Waiting for the egg to hatch -->
