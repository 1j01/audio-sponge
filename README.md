# Audio Sponge (working title)

soak up some sound, and squeeze some sound out

maybe it music! (...not *good* music, but maybe you can define it as such, as music... that's up to you)

this URL will change: https://station.now.sh/

### What it do tho?

* collects audio by streaming from SoundCloud, OpenGameArt, and/or the filesystem (TODO: more sources; Napster would be good, maybe Spotify)

* takes random slices from the audio it collects (while streaming) (TODO: detect beats for percussion, and perhaps pitch/harmonics for melody)

* plays the sounds in randomly structured rhythms (TODO: rhyme and reason, and effects, and melody!)

* streams to listeners on a [webpage](https://station.now.sh/) (TODO: make this more robust, esp. when clients pause the stream)

### Development Setup

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/audio-sponge)

or:

1. [Clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
2. Install [Node.js]() if you don't have it already
3. `npm i` to install dependencies
4. `npm start`

### Configuration

To enable SoundCloud as a source, add a `SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID` key the `.env` file.
[You'll need to get a client ID somehow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40992480/getting-a-soundcloud-api-client-id)

To enable the filesystem as a source, add an `AUDIO_SOURCE_FILES_GLOB` key the `.env` file, e.g.
```
AUDIO_SOURCE_FILES_GLOB=C:\Users\Isaiah\Music\**\*.mp3
```
It must be a full path; that is, `%` or `$` variables are NOT supported.
