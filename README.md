# Audio Sponge (working title)

Soak up some sound, and squeeze some sound out

maybe it music!â„¢ (...it's not *GOOD* music, but maybe you can define it as such, as music... that's up to you. That's up to you - that's your mission, if you choose to accept it: a quest to categorize a cacophony as candidly as you can as.. music..)

Currently deployed here: https://station.now.sh/

The stream itself is here: https://station.now.sh/stream

## What it does

* Collects audio by streaming from SoundCloud, OpenGameArt, and/or the filesystem

* Takes random slices from the audio it collects (while streaming)

* Plays the sound slices in randomly structured rhythms

* Streams to listeners on a [webpage](https://station.now.sh/)

## TODO

- Gather sources as a continuous process!
- More sources; Napster would be good, maybe Spotify
- Better structure (add in layers over time, and have sections like in a song)
- Effects (I want to do crazy DSP, ideally with limits that make it not go annoyingly high pitched or loud or distort the sound until you can't hear it, but that'll be difficult)
- Melody (could detect pitch/harmonics in samples, and do granular synthesis)
- Detect beats for percussion (to get a more punchy, less wonky sound/rhythm)
- Better name! Any suggestions? [Please share!](mailto:isaiahodhner@gmail.com)

## Development Setup

1. [Clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
2. Install [Node.js]() if you don't have it already
3. `npm i` to install dependencies
4. `npm start`

## Configuration

### SoundCloud

To enable SoundCloud as a source, add a `SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID` key the `.env` file.
[You'll need to get a client ID somehow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40992480/getting-a-soundcloud-api-client-id)

### FileSystem

To enable the filesystem as a source, add an `AUDIO_SOURCE_FILES_GLOB` key the `.env` file, e.g.
```
AUDIO_SOURCE_FILES_GLOB=C:\Users\Isaiah\Music\**\*.mp3
```
It must be a full path; that is, `%` or `$` variables are NOT supported.

The files MUST be **MP3** files.

### OpenGameArt

No configuration. TODO: option to toggle on/off.

## Deployment

Deploy to [Now](https://zeit.co/now) with `npm run deploy`

First install Now with `npm i -g now`

## Project Structure

Written in [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/). (Could change to TypeScript later.)

[`server.coffee`](src/server.coffee) is the main entry point for the server.

The most interesting stuff is in [`Sponge.coffee`](src/Sponge.coffee); this handles generating the audio (using [web-audio-engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-audio-engine)), as well as collecting audio at the top level. (At the lower level, it uses several audio providers located in [`src/audio-providers/`](src/audio-providers))

The client code is in [`public/`](public/).

[Fontello](http://fontello.com/) is currently used for some icons representing the audio providers but this could change to using favicons and be simpler.
Workflow: drag [`config.json`](public/fontello/config.json) to Fontello, update font, download zip and replace [`fontello/`](public/fontello/)
