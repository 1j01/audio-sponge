# Audio Sponge (working title)

soak up some sound, and squeeze some sound out

maybe it music!

------------

### What it do tho?

* globs a bunch of audio files (TODO: stream from other sources)

* chooses random slices from the sources (TODO: detect beats and such)

* plays the sounds in random rhythms (TODO: rhyme and reason - and effects!)

* streams to listeners on a webpage (TODO: host stream and site)

------------

### Are these songs?

no they just names:

* In equal and opposite measure
* Cathartic cacophony
* Retched reverbertations
* Spontanious sound shenanigans
* Automatic chaotic euphony
* Synthetic symphonic hodgepodge
* Percussive pandemonium & rambunctious rhythm
* Wayward librettist - ~~Markov~~ would be so und\*
* Select the server other is file not play
* Large birds, soft cheese, green fruit
* A gathering of empty places
* I would understand a colorless green idea
* Cozy paranoia
* Primary reality beta
<!-- * Every day route and patch -->
<!-- * Waiting for the egg to hatch -->
<!-- * Warning: abstraction required -->
<!-- * I hope Windows doesn't update -->

\*It would be ["Nonsensical"](https://github.com/1j01/nonsensical) to use plain old Markov text chains in this project
