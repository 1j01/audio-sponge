# Audio Sponge (working title)

soak up some sound, and squeeze some sound out

maybe it music! (not yet, not really, unless you're into anti-music/postmusic type stuff)

this URL will change: https://station.now.sh/

### What it do tho?

* streams audio from SoundCloud and OpenGameArt (TODO: more sources)

* chooses random slices from the sources (TODO: detect beats for percussion and perhaps pitch/harmonics for melody)

* plays the sounds in randomly structured rhythms (TODO: rhyme and reason - and effects!)

* streams to listeners on a webpage (TODO: make this more robust)
